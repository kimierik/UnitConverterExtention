# this is a firefox extention that allows you to convert units fast

you need to compule the wasm code if you download from source  
run " wasm-pack build --target web  "  when in the addon-wasm directory  
  
  
currently only supports weigth and some distance measurement units
  
  
calculations are done in wasm bc this is a school project that needed to use it
